# Mutini

Mutini was built at the [Reroute/SF Hackathon](http://hattery.com/reroute/) Oct 19-21, 2012.

## How to use

	$ npm install -g meteorite

Then clone the muni-muntanty repo, cd into it, then run (with your port of choice):

	$ mrt run --port 8000

mrt should grab packages that I've added for you. If not, you might need to add them.

	$ mrt add router
	$ mrt add backbone
